## Description

I wrote you a [song](https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/static/c0863a3b0170d6dd176be3a595b4b75e/lyrics.txt). Put it in the picoCTF{} flag format.

## Hints

1. Do you think you can master rockstar?

## Solution

Copy the lyrics from `lyrics.txt` into (Rockstar)[https://codewithrockstar.com/online]. The output is several decimal values. Convert the decimal values into ASCII characters and enclose the decoded string with `picoCTF{}` and that is the flag.

## Flag

## Description

To get truly 1337, you must understand different data encodings, such as hexadecimal or binary. Can you get the flag from this program to prove you are on the way to becoming 1337? Connect with `nc jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org 15130`.

## Hints

1. I hear python can convert things.

2. It might help to have multiple windows open.

## Solution

After entering in the `nc` command you will have 45 seconds to answer three questions relating to converting values into ASCII characters. You need to convert from binary, octal and hexademical values into ASCII characters to form a word. Using (CyberChef)[https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/] may help here.

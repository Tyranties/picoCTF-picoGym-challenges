## Description

Cryptography can be easy, do you know what ROT13 is? `cvpbPGS{abg_gbb_onq_bs_n_ceboyrz}`

## Hints

1. This can be solved online if you don't want to do it by hand!

## Solution

We are told that the flag is encrypted using ROT13. Therefore to decrypt the flag, for each character, we need to shift it back 13 places to get the plaintext character. The flag will be revealed after doing that for all characters. [Python code to decrypt ROT13](../mod-26/rot13-decryption.py).

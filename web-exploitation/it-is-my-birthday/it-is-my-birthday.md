## Description

I sent out 2 invitations to all of my friends for my birthday! I'll know if they get stolen because the two invites look similar, and they even have the same md5 hash, but they are slightly different! You wouldn't believe how long it took me to find a collision. Anyway, see if you're invited by submitting 2 PDFs to my website. http://mercury.picoctf.net:57247/

## Hints

1. Look at the category of this problem.

2. How may a PHP site check the rules in the description?

## Solution

When we first visit the website, we can input two PDF files and then upload them to see if we are invited to the birthday party.

We see from the description that two invitations are valid if they have the same md5 hash.

Use two PDFs with the same MD5 hash. One such pair can be found [here](https://github.com/corkami/collisions/tree/master/examples/free).

After submiting the two pdfs we are then redirected to a web page which contains the following PHP code.

```php
<?php

if (isset($_POST["submit"])) {
    $type1 = $_FILES["file1"]["type"];
    $type2 = $_FILES["file2"]["type"];
    $size1 = $_FILES["file1"]["size"];
    $size2 = $_FILES["file2"]["size"];
    $SIZE_LIMIT = 18 * 1024;

    if (($size1 < $SIZE_LIMIT) && ($size2 < $SIZE_LIMIT)) {
        if (($type1 == "application/pdf") && ($type2 == "application/pdf")) {
            $contents1 = file_get_contents($_FILES["file1"]["tmp_name"]);
            $contents2 = file_get_contents($_FILES["file2"]["tmp_name"]);

            if ($contents1 != $contents2) {
                if (md5_file($_FILES["file1"]["tmp_name"]) == md5_file($_FILES["file2"]["tmp_name"])) {
                    highlight_file("index.php");
                    die();
                } else {
                    echo "MD5 hashes do not match!";
                    die();
                }
            } else {
                echo "Files are not different!";
                die();
            }
        } else {
            echo "Not a PDF!";
            die();
        }
    } else {
        echo "File too large!";
        die();
    }
}

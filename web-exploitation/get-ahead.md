## Description

Find the flag being held on this server to get ahead of the competition http://mercury.picoctf.net:53554/

## Hints

1. Maybe you have more than 2 choices

2. Check out tools like Burpsuite to modify your requests and look at the responses

## Solution

Using Burpsuite we can intercept an HTTP requests made by the wbsite. Inspecting these requests we can see that a "GET" was used for Red and "POST" was used for Blue.

From the title of the challenge as a hint we can use the "HEAD" request method. Modify one of these requests to use the "HEAD" request method and after forwarding this modified request the flag will be shown.

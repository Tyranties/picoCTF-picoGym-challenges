## Solution

As the title of the challenge suggests, this challenge is all about cookies. When visting the website for the first time, we are greeted with a prompt telling us to enter a cookie name.

To see the website's cookies go to DevTools > Application > Cookies and you should see 1 cookie called "name" with a value of -1. Entering "snickerdoodle" changes the value to 0 and if we enter "chocolate chip" the value changes to 1. This means that the value of the "name" cookie might be something to do with this challenge.

Using the developer tools, we are able to change the valye of the cookie and refresh the page to see the changes. For example, if value is changed to 2, then we should see the prompt changes to "oatmeal raisin" cookies.

The flag can be found by changing the value to 18.

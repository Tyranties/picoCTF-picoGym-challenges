## Hints

2. There's 3 parts

## Solution

Go the Sources tab with DevTools > Sources. Then navigate to top > jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org > problem/44924 and you should find three files `44924/`, `myjs.js` and `mycss.css`.

The first part of the flag is found in `44924/` which contains the HTML code for this website and can be found on line 31.

The second part of the flag is found in `mycss.css` which contains the CSS code for this website and can be found on line 51.

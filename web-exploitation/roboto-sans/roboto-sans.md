## Solution

Going to this website, we see the yoga website we saw in some other challenges.

The title of this challenge alludes to going to `robots.txt`. If we go theree we see the following:

```
User-agent *
Disallow: /cgi-bin/
Think you have seen your flag or want to keep looking.

ZmxhZzEudHh0;anMvbXlmaW
anMvbXlmaWxlLnR4dA==
svssshjweuiwl;oiho.bsvdaslejg
Disallow: /wp-admin/
```

The three strings at the bottom `ZmxhZzEudHh0;anMvbXlmaW`, `anMvbXlmaWxlLnR4dA==` and `svssshjweuiwl;oiho.bsvdaslejg` are all encoded Base64 strings. Decoding them will reveal they are paths to other files and the last string being giberish. These are `flag1.txtjs/myfi` and `js/myfile.txt`.

Going to `flag1.txtjs/myfi` gives us an error 500, however, going to `js/myfile.txt` will reveal the flag.

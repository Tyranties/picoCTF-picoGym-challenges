## Description

The developer of this website mistakenly left an important artifact in the website source, can you find it?
The website is [here](http://saturn.picoctf.net:59405/)

## Hints

1. How could you mirror the website on your local machine so you could use more powerful tools for searching?

## Solution

Going to the given website gives us a website for a Yoga company called Flexed.

To mirror the website on our local machine we use the `wget` command on a Linux terminal.

```bash
wget http://saturn.picoctf.net:59405/
```

We can then use the `grep` command to search all the files relating to the website. This can be done by using "picoCTF" as the keyword we want to search for.

```bash
grep -rl "picoCTF" /saturn.picoctf.net:59405
```

The output tells us there is a match in `css/style.css` and searching that file, we can find the flag on line 328.

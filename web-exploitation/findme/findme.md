Using the given username of `test` and password of `test!` we are able to login to another webpage where we can search for flags.

However, the hint tells us to look at redirections, so using Burp Suite, we are able to see two directions.

From both HTTP request messages we can see some strings encoded with Base64 in the next page id. `cGljb0NURntwcm94aWVzX2Fs` for the first request and `bF90aGVfd2F5XzAxZTc0OGRifQ==` for the second. Decoding the two strings and combining them will give us the flag.

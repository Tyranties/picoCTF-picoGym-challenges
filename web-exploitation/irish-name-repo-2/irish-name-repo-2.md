## Description

There is a website running at `https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/53751/` ([link](https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/53751/)). Someone has bypassed the login before, and now it's being strengthened. Try to see if you can still login! or http://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org:53751

## Hints

1. The password is being filtered.

## Solution

This challenge is nearly identical to that of [Irish-Name-Repo 1](/web-exploitation/irish-name-repo-1/irish-name-repo-1.md), but the password is now filtered.

However, the exact same username and password combination of the username being `admin'--` and the password being any string can used in the first challenge can be used here to get the flag.

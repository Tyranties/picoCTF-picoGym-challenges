## Description

There is a website running at `https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/53751/` ([link](https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/53751/)). Someone has bypassed the login before, and now it's being strengthened. Try to see if you can still login! or http://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org:53751

## Hints

1. Seems like the password is encrypted.

## Solution

This challenge is nearly identical to that of [Irish-Name-Repo 1](/web-exploitation/irish-name-repo-1/irish-name-repo-1.md) and [Irish-Name-Repo 2](/web-exploitation/irish-name-repo-1/irish-name-repo-2.md) , but the admin log in form now only requires a password.

Type any password into the field and use Burp Suite to intercept the HTTP request. We notice on line 20 of the request there is an option called `debug` set to `0`. Change it to a `1` and then forward the edited HTTP request.

```
password=password&debug=1
```

With debug mode on, we can see the SQL query being used. The password that we have entered is also encrypted as `password` has been ecnrypted into `cnffjbeq`.

We notice that the two s's in "password" has been encrypted to the same letter. This suggests that a caeser cipher was used here. More investigations with the other letters reveal that a caeser cipher was used here with the shift being 13.

We now use the plaintext password `A' IS NOT 'B` and encrypt it using the caser cipher. This will turn the plaintext into a ciphertext of `N' VF ABG 'O`.

Using `N' VF ABG 'O` as the password will successfuly log us in as the admin and reveal the flag.
